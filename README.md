# EpiGimp

Prototype GIMP-like editor using PySide6.

## Run

1. Create a virtualenv and install requirements:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run:

```bash
python main.py
```

# Notes


- The code is intentionally minimal and meant as a starting point. It provides a working PySide6 window and a simple canvas that can load/save images and convert to/from NumPy arrays.
- From here you can add tools, layer management UI, undo/redo, and plugin-based filters.


---


If you want, I can now:
- generate these files on disk for you (as a downloadable archive), or
- expand individual components (e.g. full layer panel, simple brush tool, plugin example).


Tell me which next step you prefer.
